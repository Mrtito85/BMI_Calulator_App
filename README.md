# BMI_Calulator_App
This is my first Android app, a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Java and XML in Android Studio. The app allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI and see a result indicating whether they are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
